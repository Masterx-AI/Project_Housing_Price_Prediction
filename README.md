### Description:

A simple yet challenging project, to predict the housing price based on certain factors like house area, bedrooms, furnished, nearness to mainroad, etc. The dataset is small yet, it's complexity arises due to the fact that it has strong multicollinearity. Can you overcome these obstacles & build a decent predictive model?

### Objective:
- Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
- Build Regression models to predict the price w.r.t a single & multiple feature.
- Also evaluate the models & compare thier respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

### Here are some of the key outcomes of the project:
- The Dataset was quiet small totally just 545 samples & after preprocessing 2.2% of the datasamples were dropped. 
- Visualising the distribution of data & their relationships, helped us to get some insights on the feature-set.
- The features had high multicollinearity, hence in Feature Extraction step, we used VIF & RFE Techniques to drop highly correlated features.
- Testing multiple algorithms with default hyperparamters gave us some understanding for various models performance on this specific dataset.
- While, Polynomial Regression (Order-5) was slightly overfitting, it is safe to use multiple regression algorithm, as their scores were quiet comparable & also they're more generalisable.
